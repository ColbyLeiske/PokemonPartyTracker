# Overview
Track the status of all your pokemon in your party in realtime.

# How it works
This points to your emulator and attempts to find where the GBA RAM is located in the current running process. After doing this, it can read your party and all of their information.

# Will this corrupt my save?
No, this is a READ-ONLY process. It will never write to your memory and potentially corrupt something.

# Tested Emulators
